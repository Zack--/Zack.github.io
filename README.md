# Disclaimer

This is a list I curate every now and then, mostly targetted to a UK/European audience (check links in PFW's guide below for US links)

Order of links is irrelevant, they are all equally important.

If you care about having a positive impact around you, start here.

If you're feeling lost and unsure of what to do, donate.

Go vote.
